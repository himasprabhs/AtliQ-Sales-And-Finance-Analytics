## 1. Customer Performance Report

### Key Visualizations & Findings:
- The overall net sales grew from¬†**$87.5M in 2019**¬†to¬†**$598.9M in 2021**, showing an impressive¬†**304.5% growth from 2020 to 2021**.
- Certain customers, such as¬†**Nova**, experienced extraordinary growth rates, like¬†**2664.9%**. This suggests either a new partnership or significant changes in sales strategies with these clients.

### Recommendations:
1. **Focus on High Performers:**¬†Nurture partnerships with top earners (*Amazon, Leader, Atliq Exclusive*) to ensure consistent revenue streams.
2. **Support Emerging Players:**¬†Provide targeted support to high-growth customers (*Chiptec, Integration Stores, Nova*) to help sustain their growth.
3. **Investigate Slow Performers:**¬†Explore potential barriers for lagging customers (*Flipkart, Forward Stores*) and implement strategies to accelerate their growth.

## 2. Market Performance vs Target Report

#### I've analyzed the performance report from AtliQ Hardwares, which compares market performance versus targets for various countries from 2019 to 2021. Here's a summary:

### Key Visualizations & Findings:

- **Overall Performance**:
    - The grand total for 2021 is $598.9M, falling short by $54.9M from the target, resulting in an overall shortfall of -8.40%.
- **Top Performers**:
    - **India**: Despite missing the target by $9.6M, India had a massive contribution with a net sales of $161.3M, resulting in a relatively low deviation of -5.59%.
    - **USA**: The USA achieved sales of $87.8M, missing the target by $10.2M, with a deviation of -10.44%.
- **Notable Shortfalls**:
    - **Canada**: With a significant shortfall of $5.1M, Canada fell short by -12.63%.
    - **Spain**: Showed a notable deviation of -12.39%.
- **Consistent Under-performance**:
    - % wise ‚ÄòPoland‚Äô is the country, where you are lagging the most -15.35%.
    - **Germany** and **Indonesia**: Both countries showed significant shortfalls of -11.29% and -11.45%, respectively.

              **üí°However this is alright as we had set some aggressive targets. That‚Äôs why we are lagging behind.**

### Recommendations:
1. **Focus on Top Markets**: Given India and the USA are major contributors, there should be a strategic focus on these markets to bridge the shortfall gap.
2. **Investigate High Shortfall Regions**: Countries like Poland and Canada with high negative deviations need a detailed analysis to understand underlying issues.
3. **Adjust Targets**: Revising targets based on realistic and achievable metrics can help in setting more practical goals.

By addressing these insights, businesses can optimize their strategies to better align with their targets and foster growth.

### Key Visualizations & Findings:

- Net Sales have shown a remarkable increase over the three years, particularly in 2021, indicating significant business expansion and increased market penetration.
- Gross Margin has shown substantial growth, closely following the trend in Net Sales. This indicates that despite the rising COGS, the business has managed to maintain profitability.
- Although the Gross Margin percentage has decreased slightly, the overall growth in Gross Margin suggests that the company has been able to manage costs effectively while scaling up operations.

### Recommendations:

- **Cost Management**: Given the higher rate of increase in COGS compared to Net Sales, focusing on optimizing procurement and production processes could help maintain or improve Gross Margin percentage.
- **Sales Strategies**: The significant growth in Net Sales is a positive indicator. Continuing to invest in successful sales and marketing strategies will be crucial.
- **Efficiency Improvements**: Identifying and addressing areas where costs can be reduced without compromising quality will help improve overall profitability.
- **Financial Planning**: Implementing robust financial planning and monitoring systems will ensure that the company remains aligned with its growth targets and manages its resources effectively.
